We first give the following definitions:

\defn{
    A map $p:X\to S$ is called:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item An \term{inner fibration} if it is in $\RLP\{\l^i[n]\to\d[n]\mid 0<i<n\}$;
        \item A \term{left fibration} if it is in $\RLP\{\l^i[n]\to\d[n]\mid 0\le i<n\}$;
        \item A \term{right fibration} if it is in $\RLP\{\l^i[n]\to\d[n]\mid 0<i\le n\}$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

An inner fibration is what we generally want a ``good functor'' between $\infty$-categories look like, since for every functor $F:\catC\to\catD$
between ordinary categories, $\N(F)$ is an inner fibration. On the other hand, left and right fibrations come from the previous section,
and the reader may verify that a functor $F:\catC\to\catD$ between ordinary categories is a left (or right) fibration if and only if
$\N(f)$ is.

We also shall give the following definition:

\defn{
    A map $i:A\to B$ is called:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item An \term{inner anodyne extension} if it is in $\Cof\{\l^i[n]\to\d[n]\mid 0<i<n\}$;
        \item A \term{left anodyne extension} if it is in $\Cof\{\l^i[n]\to\d[n]\mid 0\le i<n\}$;
        \item A \term{right anodyne extension} if it is in $\Cof\{\l^i[n]\to\d[n]\mid 0<i\le n\}$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

We will first study the stability properties of such maps under certain constructions.
