We now describe how most aspects of ordinary categories extends to infinity categories. 

\rmk{
    As we have stated above, since the three models are equivalent models for $(\infty,1)$-categories, what wen have defined for 
    $\infty$-categories (that are invariant under categorical equivalences) should extends naturally to topological categories
    and simplicial categories. The readers may feel free to use the results we have stated for $\infty$-categories on topological categories
    and simplicial categories, if they prefer.
}

\defn{
    Suppose $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category. An \term{object} in $\catC$ is a vertex in $\catC$. A \term{morphism} in $\catC$ is a $1$-simplex
    in $\catC$. The \term{domain} and \term{codomain} of a morphism $\phi:\d[1]\to\catC$ are $\phi(0)$ and $\phi(1)$, respectively.
    If a morphism $\phi$ has domain $x$ and codomain $y$, we write $\phi:x\to y$. The \term{identity morphism} of an object $x$ is
    $\1_x:=s_0(x):x\to y$.
}

\defn{
    Suppose $S$ is a simplicial set. We define the \term{opposite} of $S$ to be the simplicial set $S^\op$, with $S^\op_n=S_n$ but
    $$(d_i:S^\op_n\to S^\op_{n-1})=(d_{n-i}:S_n\to S_{n-1}),(s_i:S^\op_n\to S^\op_{n+1})=(s_{n-i}:S_n\to S_{n+1}).$$
    If $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category, we call $\catC^\op$ the \term{opposite category} of $\catC$.
}

We next consider equivalences between morphisms.

\defn{
    Suppose $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category. Two morphisms $f,g:x\to y$ in $\catC$ are said to be \term{homotopic}, 
    written as $f\simeq g$, if one of the following equivalence relations hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item There exists a $2$-simplex $\vcenter{\xymatrix @R=5pt{x\ar[rd]^f\ar[dd]_{\1_x}&\\&y\\x\ar[ru]_g&}}$ in $\catC$;
        \item There exists a $2$-simplex $\vcenter{\xymatrix @R=5pt{x\ar[rd]^g\ar[dd]_{\1_x}&\\&y\\x\ar[ru]_f&}}$ in $\catC$;
        \item There exists a $2$-simplex $\vcenter{\xymatrix @R=5pt{&y\ar[dd]^{\1_y}\\x\ar[ru]^f\ar[rd]_g&\\&y}}$ in $\catC$;
        \item There exists a $2$-simplex $\vcenter{\xymatrix @R=5pt{&y\ar[dd]^{\1_y}\\x\ar[ru]^g\ar[rd]_f&\\&y}}$ in $\catC$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

\prop{
    The homotopic relation is an equivalence relation.
}

\defn{
    Suppose $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category. We define a category $\pi(\catC)$ as follows:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
    \item Its objects are vertices of $\catC$;
    \item For any $x,y\in\catC_0$, define
    $\Hom_{\pi(\catC)}(x,y)=\{f:x\to y\in\catC_1\}/\simeq$;
    \item For any $x\in\catC_0$, define $\1_x=[s_0x]$;
    \item For any morphisms $[f]:x\to y,[g]:y\to z$ in $\pi(\catC)$, take a lift
    of the following diagram:
    $$\xymatrix @C=40pt{
    \l^1[2]\ar[rr]^{f\text{ on }\d\{0,1\}}_{g\text{ on }\d\{1,2\}}\ar[d]&&\catC\\
    \d[2]\ar@{.>}[rru]_{h}&&
    }$$
    and define $[g]\circ[f]=[d_1h]$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

\prop{
    The category $\pi(\catC)$ is isomorphic to the category $\Ho(\catC)$, meaning that two morphisms $f\simeq g$ if and only if thet are equal in 
    $\Ho\catC$.
}

Next we discuss the mapping spaces between objects.

\defn{
    Suppose $S$ is a simplicial set, $x,y$ are vertices in $S$. We define the \term{mapping space} from $x$ to $y$ to be 
    $\Map_S(x,y):=\Hom_{\h S}(x,y)\in\cat H$.
}

So how shall we compute this mapping space? By definition, $\Map_S(x,y)$ is the homotopy type of $\Hom_{\C[S]}(x,y)$.
The advantage of this definition is that it has a natural composition law, and it works for all simplicial sets, not just $\infty$-categories.
However, this construction is quite complicated, and it is usually not a Kan complex, which makes it difficult to verify its properties.

We shall now introduce another simplicial set that represents the homotopy type $\Map_S(x,y)$, at least when $S$ is an $\infty$-category.

\defn{
    Suppose $S$ is a simplicial set, $x,y$ are vertices in $S$. We define $$\Hom^R_S(x,y)=\{\sigma\in S_{n+1}
    \mid\sigma|_{\d\{0,\cdots,n\}}=x,\sigma(n+1)=y\},$$ and $$\Hom^L_S(x,y)=\{\sigma\in S_{n+1}\mid\sigma(0)=x,\sigma|_{\d\{1,\cdots,n+1\}}=y\}.$$
    Moreover we define $$\Hom_S(x,y)=\{\sigma:\d[n]\times\d[1]\to S\mid \sigma|_{\d[n]\times\{0\}}=x,\sigma|_{\d[n]\times\{1\}}=y\}.$$
}

The following proposition will be proved in Section \texttt{\color{ff0000}[ERROR! SECTION NOT FOUND]}
and \texttt{\color{ff0000}[ERROR! SECTION NOT FOUND]}.

\prop{
    If $S$ is an $\infty$-category, then for any objects $x,y$, the simplicial sets $\Hom^R_S(x,y),\Hom^L_S(x,y),\Hom_S(x,y)$ are Kan complexes. 
    There exists a canonical isomorphism $$\Hom^R_S(x,y)\xrightarrow{\simeq}\Hom_{\C[S]}(x,y)$$ in the category $\cat H$. The natural inclusions
    $$\Hom^R_S(x,y)\hookrightarrow\Hom_S(x,y)\hookleftarrow\Hom^L_S(x,y)$$ are weak homotopy equivalences.
}

We next discuss when can we say a morphism is an equivalence.

\defn{
    Suppose $\catC$ is a topological category, of a simplicial category, or an $\infty$-category. A morphism $f$ in $\catC$ is called an
    \term{equivalence}, or \term{invertible}, if it is an isomorphism in $\h\catC$.
}

The following criterion is useful while we want to determine whether a morphism is an equivalence or not.

\prop{
    Suppose $\catC$ is a topological category, $f:X\to Y$ is a morphism in $\catC$. The following conditions are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}[i)]
        \item $f$ is an equivalence;
        \item $f$ has a homotopy inverse; that is, there exists a morphism $g:Y\to X$ such that $fg\simeq \1_Y$ and $gf\simeq\1_X$;
        \item For any $Z\in\catC$, composition with $f$ induces a homotopy equivalence $\Hom_\catC(Z,X)\to\Hom_\catC(Z,Y)$;
        \item For any $Z\in\catC$, composition with $f$ induces a weak homotopy equivalence $\Hom_\catC(Z,X)\to\Hom_\catC(Z,Y)$;
        \item For any $Z\in\catC$, composition with $f$ induces a homotopy equivalence $\Hom_\catC(Y,Z)\to\Hom_\catC(X,Z)$;
        \item For any $Z\in\catC$, composition with $f$ induces a weak homotopy equivalence $\Hom_\catC(Y,Z)\to\Hom_\catC(X,Z)$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

The following proposition will be proved in Section \texttt{\color{ff0000}[ERROR! SECTION NOT FOUND]}.

\prop{
    Suppose $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category, $\phi$ is a morphism in $\catC$. $\phi$ is an equivalence, if and only if for every
    map $f:\l^0[n]\to\catC$ such that $f|_{\d\{0,1\}}=\phi$, $f$ extends to a map $\d[n]\to\catC$.
}

Using this proposition we obtain the following result:

\prop{
    Suppose $\catC$ is a simplicial set. The following conditions are equivalent:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\catC$ is an $\infty$-groupoid;
        \item $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category and $\Ho\catC$ is a groupoid;
        \item $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category and $\catC$ has extension property with respect to all inclusions $\l^0[n]\to\d[n]$;
        \item $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category and $\catC$ has extension property with respect to all inclusions $\l^n[n]\to\d[n]$.
    \end{enumerate}
}

Next we talk about the ``underlying $\infty$-groupoid of an $\infty$-category''.

\prop{
    Suppose that $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category. Let $\catC'\subseteq\catC$ be the lergest simplicial subset of $\catC$
    such that all edges of $\catC'$ are invertible in $\catC$. Then $\catC$ is a Kan complex. Moreover for any Kan complex $K$,
    the induced map $\Hom_{\cat{SSet}}(K,\catC')\to\Hom_{\cat{SSet}}(K,\catC)$ is an isomorphism. We call $\catC'$ the \term{largest
    Kan complex} contained in $\catC$. If $f:\catC\to\catD$ is a categorical equivalence between $\infty$-categories, then the induced map
    $f':\catC'\to\catD'$ between the largest Kan complexes is a homotopy equivalence.
    \footnote{The lecturer cannot figure out a proof to the last assertion while not using the Joyal model structure of simplicial sets,
    although the book said that it can be proved directly.}
}

We next consider diagrams on $\infty$-categories. This gives rises to the difference between homotopy-commutative diagrams
and homotopy-coherent diagrams, as it has been promised that we will discuss it in this section. 

The issue is as follows. Suppose $\catC$ is an $\infty$-category (or a topological category, simplicial category). To a first approximation,
it is very similar to work on $\catC$ and $\h\catC$, since they have the same objects and morphisms. However, in $\catC$, we should ask
whether or not two morphisms are equivalent or homotopic, but not equal. In this case, the homotopy between the morphisms need to
be taken in consider, since they may as well affect the higher-dimensional homotopies. However, a commutative diagram in $\h\catC$,
does not contain the information on the homotopies between the morphisms. Consequencely, commutative diagrams on $\h\catC$, which corresponds
to the notion of \term{homotopy commuative diagrams} on $\catC$, is quite unnatural and need to be refined by the notion of
\term{homotopy coherent diagrams} on $\catC$.

Let us give two examples.
