We use some simple examples to give the motivation of $\infty$-categories.

\eg{\label{tagk}
    Suppose $X$ is a topological space. The \term{fundamental groupoid} of $X$, denoted $\Pi_{\le 1}(X)$, is the category with:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item objects being all points in $X$; and
        \item $\Hom_{\Pi_{\le 1}(X)}(a,b)$ being the homotopy classes of all paths from $a$ to $b$.
    \end{itemize}
    This is some definition that we shall already have seen in algebraic topology. This gives rise to a functor $\Pi_{\le 1}:\cat{Top}\to\cat{Gpd}$.
    Moreover, for any map $f:X\to Y$ of topological spaces, $\Pi_{\le 1}(f)$ is an equivalence of categories, if and only if 
    it is fully faithful and essentially surjective, where the first assertion indicates that $\pi_1(f)$ is a bijection, and the second assertion
    indicates that $\pi_0(f)$ is a bijection. 

    However, a topological space, contains far more information than its 0th and 1st homotopy groups. There also not only exist
    homotopies between paths, there also exist homotopies between homotopies, and homotopies between the homotopies between homotopies, etc.
    How shall we encode such higher structures? We may think of a ``category'', with not only morphisms between objects, but also morphisms
    between morphisms, and morphisms between the morphisms between morphisms, etc. Specifically, we would like to define $\Pi(X)$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Objects being all points $a,b,\cdots$ in $X$; 
        \item $\Hom_{\Pi(X)}(a,b)$ being all paths $\gamma,\delta,\cdots$ from $a$ to $b$;
        \item $\Hom_{\Pi(X)}(\gamma,\delta)$ being all homotopies $H,K,\cdots$ from $\gamma$ to $\delta$;
        \item $\cdots$
    \end{itemize}
    And we would like to obtain the property that for any map $f:X\to Y$ of topological spaces, $\Pi(f)$ is an ``equivalence'' of
    ``categories'', if and only if $f$ induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups; that is, $f$ is a weak homotopy equivalence.
    The theory of $\infty$-categories are introduced to make this thought precise and to study their properties.

\eg{
    We recall homotopies between maps in model categories: Given a model category $\catC$ and cofibrant-fibrant objects $A,B$,
    maps $f,g:A\to B$, a homotopy from $f$ to $g$ is equivalent to a map $h:A\ox\d[1]\to B$, such that $h|_{A\ox0}=f,h|_{A\ox1}=g$.
    However, cosimplicial frames not only allow us to construct the cylinder object of $A$, but also higher structures.
    For example, a map $A\ox\d[2]\to B$ may be viewed as a homotopy between the three homotopies given by its restriction on
    $A\ox\p\d[2]$, a map $A\ox\d[3]\to B$ may be viewed as a homotopy between the four homotopies between homotopies
    given by its restriction on $A\ox\p\d[3]$. The theory of $\infty$-categories gives us a tool on how to 
    formalize this kind of higher structures, and to study their properties.
}

Notice, that in these two examples, higher morphisms are ``invertible'' (homotopies are invertible, at least up to higher homotopies).
This also coincides with most usages of $\infty$-categories, as in most applications we may see. Therefore, we only talk about
$\infty$-categories, whose ``$k$-morphisms'' are invertible whenever $k\ge 2$. \footnote{In higher category theory, we use 
the term $(\infty,n)$-category to indicate an $\infty$-category whose $k$-morphisms are invertible whenever $k\ge n+1$. In other words,
what we are focusing about is $(\infty,1)$-categories.}

So how shall we define them? The most na\"ive approach is to define them as what we did in Section \ref{seca}. However, notice one thing: 
in both examples, associativity and unit axioms fails to be strict, but only hold up to homotopy, i.e. higher morphisms. To fix this issue,
one must add certain extra diagrams to give the correct notion of higher categories, rather than the ones given in Section \ref{seca}.
(The reason we introduce them in the first chapter is to make the language we use concise. However, pseudo-2-functors, DO give an approach to
functors between $\infty$-categories, as they keep the homotopy-coherent ideas. From now on, we will call that kind of 2-category
introduced in Section \ref{seca} \term{strict 2-categories}.) On the other hand, even the explicit definition of a 3-category 
is EXTREMELY complicated, and things are just getting worse when we pass to 4-categories and beyond.

Fortunately, we have an alternative approach to the theory of $\infty$-categories.

From our na\"ive thought, if we take the ``Hom-thing'' between two object in an $\infty$-category, it will result in an $(\infty,0)$-category.
In other words, $\infty$-categories are categories enriched over $(\infty,0)$-categories. Consequencely, we only have to make a model for
$(\infty,0)$-categories.

Notice that in Example \ref{tagk}, all morphisms, including 1-morphisms, are invertible. This means that $\Pi(X)$ ``should be
an $(\infty,0)$-category''. On the other hand, there is a general axiom, known as the \term{homotopy hypothesis},
accepted by higher categorists, which is roughly stated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Every $(\infty,0)$-category has the form $\Pi(X)$ for some topological space $X$. Moreover two $(\infty,0)$-categories 
    are equivalent, if and only if their corresponding topological spaces are weakly equivalent.
\end{itemize}

This axiom ensures that we have a one-to-one correspondence between $(\infty,0)$-categories and equivalences classes of topological spaces,
where two spaces are equivalent if and only if they are weakly equivalent. That is, we use objects 
in $\Ho\cat{Top}\simeq\Ho\cat{K}\simeq\Ho\cat{SSet}$ to describe $(\infty,0)$-categories. Because of such important role they play in
higher category theory, we give them a special name: \term{homotopy types}. We write $\cat{H}$ for the category of homotopy types.

Now we have a schematic view of $(\infty,1)$-categories: they are just $\cat{H}$-enriched categories. But this view is really, really difficult
for us to discover properties enjoyed by $\infty$-categories. We need to give models that are easy to compute. We shall now give three 
different models for us to work with.

The first model is topological categories. 

\defn{
    A \term{topological category} is a category enriched over $\cat K$, the category of all $k$-spaces.
    \footnote{The reason we use $k$-spaces here, is that $\cat K$ is a closed monoidal category, and the geometric realization plays well 
    with $k$-spaces. From now on, unless otherwise stated, when we say ``topological spaces'', what we actually mean is ``$k$-spaces.''}
}

By the definition of a topological category, if we apply the localization functor $\cat K\to\cat H$, a topological category becomes an
$\cat{H}$-enriched category. We will now specify this localization functor with the symbol $\h$. Therefore, topological categories are indeed
models for $\infty$-categories. 

\defn{
    The \term{homotopy category} of a topological category $\catC$ is $\h\catC$. Two topological categories are said to be 
    \term{(weakly) equivalent} if their homotopy categories are equivalent (viewed as $\cat H$-enriched categories).
}

Note that an equivalence between topological categories, at least in higher category theory, does not mean it is an equivalence
between $\cat K$-enriched categories. This is because essentially what we are dealing with are actually $\cat{H}$-enriched categories.

The second model is simplicial categories.

\defn{
    A \term{simplicial category} is a category enriched over $\cat{SSet}$, the category of all simplicial sets.
    \footnote{Note that a simplicial category is not equivalent to a simplicial object in the category of the categories.}
}

By the definition of a simplicial category, if we apply the localization functor $\cat{SSet}\to\cat H$, a simplicial category becomes an
$\cat{H}$-enriched category. We will, again, specify this localization functor with the symbol $\h$. Therefore, simplicial categories
are also indeed models for $\infty$-categories. 

\defn{
    The \term{homotopy category} of a simplicial category $\catC$ is $\h\catC$. Two simplicial categories are said to be 
    \term{(weakly) equivalent} if their homotopy categories are equivalent (viewed as $\cat H$-enriched categories).
}

We now consider the relations between these two relations. We already know that there exists an adjunction $(\abs{-},\Sing):\cat{SSet}\to\cat K$,
that is a closed symmetric monoidal Quillen equivalence. Consequencely, we get an adjunction 
$(\abs{-},\Sing):\cat{Cat}_{\cat{SSet}}\to\cat{Cat}_{\cat K}$. By Section \ref{secb}, this adjunction is a Quillen equivalence between the
canonical model structures on both sides. Thus both the left and right adjoints preserve equivalences, and both the unit morphisms 
and counit morphisms are equivalences. Thus the two models can be regarded as equivalent models for $(\infty,1)$-categories.

However, these two models have disadvantages. As we have said before, in most $(\infty,1)$-categories (that we actually work with), compositions
of morphisms is associative only up to homotopy. But in a topological category, composition of morphisms are associative up to nose. 
Therefore we must figure out how to transform a homotopy coherent diagram into a strictly commutative diagram. Although this is always
possible (See Section {\color{red}\texttt{[ERROR! SECTION NOT FOUND]}}), it is convenient for us to get a more flexible model 
of $(\infty,1)$-categories.

We note that in some cases, simplicial sets can regarded as categories. We may regard 0-simplices of the simplicial set as objects of the category,
and 1-simplices of the simplicial set as morphisms of the category. For example, the simplicial set $\d[n]$ can be regarded as the category, with
$n+1$ objects $\{0,1,\cdots,n\}$, with one unique arrow from $i$ to $j$ if and only if $i\le j$, and no arrow from $i$ to $j$ if otherwise.
