The following contents are given in the lectures in the spring and autumn semester of 2019. 24 lectures with a total time of 121 hours 
have been given so far in order to finish the book \textit{Higher Topos Theory}. Infinity categories are really abstract things, 
so motivations are given in order to understand them better. However, proofs to the statements are still omitted. A few statements 
remain unproofed in class due to lack of corresponding knowledge; they are marked with $\dagger$. These statements do not include 
those that are too boring to present the proofs, which do not contain any technical difficulties, however.
