The following contents are given in the lectures in the spring and autumn semester of 2019. 28 lectures with a total time of 142 hours 
were given in order to finish the book \textit{Higher Topos Theory}, except Chapters 6 and 7. Infinity categories are
really abstract things, so motivations, together with sketches of hard proofs are given in order to understand them better. 
However, details of proofs to the statements are still omitted. A few statements 
remain unproofed in class due to lack of corresponding knowledge; they are marked with $\dagger$. These statements do not include 
those that are too boring to present the proofs, which do not contain any technical difficulties, however.
